## PURPOSE OF SOFTWARE: 
This C++ project simulates a robot swarm using multiple tree data structures: Binary Search Trees (BST), self-balancing AVL trees, and Splay trees. This software includes functions for node manipulation (inserting, removing) and tree balancing.

## FILES: 
* ```swarm.h:``` The header file that contains definitions for all member vars and private/public functions for the Robot and Swarm classes.
* ```swarm.cpp:``` The source file that contains implementations for all functions defined in ```swarm.h```.
* ```driver.cpp```: A driver program that demonstrates the basic function of the Swarm class. It uses a Random class to generate random data like robot data.
* ```mytest.cpp```:
